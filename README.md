#J4M

Simple bash/*ix based backend for notes/todo tool for my work. Inspired partially by `how I imagine github works`. 

On top of it a parser will be built based on ideas from http://www.qwikitodo.com and others prototypes I made.


##State

We are making the basic backend work. On a proof of concept level we prooved it can work OK, so we are making it 
usable so we can start using as soon as possible (and then develop further). 


##Next

+ make the scripts work from /usr/bin .. by finding j4m dir in current or parent dirs or user home dir.
+ rename them to j4m_*** and make a command j4m *** work like invfox
- make a basic asortment of scripts really work w/ usage some err checking
+ make some inital way of cooperative work (so I can share this with colegue already) we have j4m sync
- use!!!
- ...


##Current usage

	  #cd to the dir of your project
	  j4m init
