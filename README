J4M
===

Simple commandline tool for my work. Notes, todos & maybe more. 

A merger of ideas from qwikitodo and others prototypes I made. From backend up meant to be appropriate for
sharing and cooperative work.


State
-----

We made the basic backend work. Prooved it can be done. But all are just local scripts.


Next
----

- make the scripts work from /usr/bin .. by finding j4m dir in current or parent dirs or user home dir.
- rename them to j4m_*** and make a command j4m *** work like invfox
- make a basic asortment of scripts really work w/ usage some err checking
- use!!!
- ...


Basic idea
----------

j4m init ; creates .j4m folder
j4m create work ; creates .j4m/work and index and src file
emacs work
j4m store work
emacs work
j4m diff work
