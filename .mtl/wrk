= Jots4me todos

~ plan

# todo versions are stored in .j3m folder
# there is index that lists all versions (blob name, date of change, parent blob, user and comment)
# there are blobs (content files in digest filenames)

 we have functions:

- to init j4m folder
+ to create new jot
+ to submit wrk file
+ to list index
+ to get blob into wrk (last version by default or previous ones)
+ to compare blobs (last to previous by default or any one)
- to post j4m online (via some standardized interface)

- functions find .j4m folder in current or looks in 5 parent folders or ~ home folder?
# initially we edit wrk file with editor (emacs ..)
- later we add commands for simple adding / marking etc of it from commandline too
- each folder can have multiple jots (main is default, main.log is it's log)

~ bigger plans

# jots4me is meant for other things than todo-s too
- dated notes (log) in folders where you work (that was initial idean notes4me => jots4me)
- plans / notifications for future / deadlines / ticketing?
- crm-ish functions ??

~ the qwikitodo / todomind ideas???

- todos then could be daily / weekly ? project based and ... ??? what to do with all those ideas????!?!?!

~ sample commands on finished product

- j4m start plans ; main is default so we don't have to create or name it
- j4m store plans ; submits the changes to main
- j4m get plans ; returns main back to last submitted version
- j4m get plans -1 ; returns to previous version (-n)
- j4m diff plans ; compares current main to last
- j4m diff plans 0 -1 ; compares last submited to previous
- j4m publish

~ made for cooperation!
- how
- initial syncs via ssh?
- l0ki as a beta co-user?


~ make a emacs mode
- to + 
+ to -
# to -
at [asdasda] asdasds
...

~ reward plan
- the cli tool is absolutely open source
- the spec how to post online is open source too (anyone can make their own solution)
- we provide one of the online syncing services with online interace based on qwikitodo realtime renderer & more

- ugotovit kako se diffi applayayo (ker je od tega odvisno par idej (kot partial editing))
- cli tool bo imel več načinov vpogleda v todo (kot "smartfilter") po subtitlu po grepih po tagih, tako da ti partial oštevilči in si zapomni zadnje oštevilčenje tako da lahko po njem editiraš (markaš + - zbrišeš updataš..)
- naredi se nek basic emacs tool M-+ M-- M-# M-~ , skip to next title.. store, push, get..
